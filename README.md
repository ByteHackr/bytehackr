<p style='text-align: justify;'> As a product security engineer with over 3 years of experience, I have gained a strong foundation in identifying and mitigating security vulnerabilities in product development. Currently, I am employed at Red Hat, where I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of open-source projects and dive deeper into my interests in operating system-level programming and algorithmic security enhancement.

My experience at Red Hat has allowed me to expand my skill set and stay up-to-date on the latest security trends and technologies. I am passionate about building secure products and take pride in my ability to identify and address potential security threats before they become a problem.

In addition to my technical skills, I am skilled at working with cross-functional teams and have the ability to effectively communicate technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and advance my career in the field of product security. I am excited to continue my journey as a product security engineer and make a positive impact on the security of the products I work on. </p>
